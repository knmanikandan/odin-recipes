    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I found many drink recipes calling for milk, turmeric, and ginger root. I sampled different amounts of each ingredient and feel this is a perfect balance between creamy almond milk, spicy ginger, and the earthy taste of turmeric. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (1 1/2 inch) piece fresh turmeric root, peeled and grated</li>
        <li>1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and grated</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>1 cup unsweetened almond milk</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1 <br> Combine turmeric root, ginger root, and honey together in a bowl, crushing the turmeric and ginger as much as possible.</li><br>
        <li>Step 2 <br> Heat almond milk in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Once small bubbles begin to form around the edges, reduce heat to low. Transfer about 2 tablespoon milk to turmeric mixture to allow mixture to soften and honey to melt into a paste-like mixture.</li><br>
        <li>Step 3 <br> Mix the turmeric paste into milk in the saucepan; raise temperature to medium-low and cook, stirring continuously, until fully combined. Blend with an immersion blender for a smooth texture.</li><br>
        <li>Step 4 <br> Pour turmeric tea into a mug and top with ground turmeric and cinnamon.</li><br>
    </ol>
